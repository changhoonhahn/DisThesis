First and foremost, I would like to thank my thesis advisor Michael R. Blanton 
for his amazing patience, encouragement, and wise thoughtful mentoring. 
From the patient guidance he gave me when I started research to the freedom 
he gave me to explore on my own, Mike has been a better advisor than 

I also extremely grateful to Roman Scoccimarro for his patient mentoring, his 
deep scientific thoughts, and his insightful yet pedagogical explanations whenever
I stepped into his office confused.
I am also extremely thankful to Jeremy L. Tinker for his friendly mentoring, constant 
encouragement and support, and always having his door open for scientific discussions.
I also wish to thank David Hogg for his guidance, support, and unending energetic 
enthusiasm for science (even fiber collisions).

This dissertation and my graduate career would not have been possible without the 
help of many more collaborators: Andrew Wetzel, Fransisco Prada, John Moustakas, 


Finally, I want to thank Lidia Cano, to whom this thesis is dedicated. Her 
unending support and encouragement over the years, not only made

%First, a huge thanks is in order for my advisor, David Hogg, for these years
%of support, encouragement, and friendship.
%I couldn't have imagined a better advisor for me and I'm looking forward to
%many years of collaboration.
%Hogg's enthusiasm is infectious and our lively discussions over lunch, coffee,
%or beer have convinced me to attempt a career in academia and made me a better
%scientist and person.

%I would also like to thank my other dissertation readers, Jonathan Goodman and
%Micheal Blanton, for taking the time to read my thesis and provide useful
%suggestions and clarifications that improved the presentation of this work.

%One of my favorite parts of studying astronomy is the community and the
%opportunities to meet and get to know amazing people from around the world.
%Over the course of my Ph.D.\ research, I have had the opportunity to
%collaborate with more people than I can possibly list here.
%I am especially grateful for the summers that I spent in Germany with Bernhard
%Sch\"olkopf and Hans-Walter Rix; the garden chats in T\"ubingen and Heidelberg
%were some of the highlights of my scientific career thus far.
%I have also enjoyed and benefited from conversations and collaborations with

%\paragraph{Organizations}
%The results in this dissertation are based, in large part, on observations
%make by the \kepler\ Mission and subsequent \KT\ Mission with the same
%instrument.
%None of my work would have been possible without the tireless efforts of the
%scientists and engineers on the \kepler\ team.
%This work also relied heavily on the public data and literature resources
%provided by the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, the NASA Exoplanet
%Archive, and the NASA Astrophysics Data System.
%
%I would like to thank the organizers and attendees of the SAMSI workshop
%``Modern Statistical and Computational Methods for Analysis of \kepler\
%Data''.
%This workshop introduced me to the \kepler\ data and drastically lowered the
%barrier to entry into the field of exoplanets.
%The connections made at this workshop have led to many important and
%long-lasting friendships and collaborations.
