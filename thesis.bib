	Abstract = {We review the formalism and applications of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe. We first discuss the dynamics of gravitational instability, from the linear to the non-linear regime. This includes Eulerian and Lagrangian PT, non-linear approximations, and a brief description of numerical simulation techniques. We then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic fields, such as correlation functions in real and Fourier space, probability distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non-Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First, we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing. We finally review the current observational situation regarding statistics in galaxy catalogs and what the future generation of galaxy surveys promises to deliver.},

@article{Bianchi:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Observed galaxy clustering exhibits local transverse statistical isotropy around the line of sight (LOS). The variation of the LOS across a galaxy survey complicates the measurement of the observed clustering as a function of the angle to the LOS, as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) based on Cartesian grids, cannot individually allow for this. Recent advances in methodology for calculating LOS-dependent clustering in Fourier space include the realization that power spectrum LOS-dependent moments can be constructed from sums over galaxies, based on approximating the LOS to each pair of galaxies by the LOS to one of them. We show that we can implement this method using multiple FFTs, each measuring the LOS-weighted clustering along different axes. The Nlog N nature of FFTs means that the computational speed-up is a factor of >1000 compared with summing over galaxies. This development should be beneficial for future projects such as DESI and Euclid which will provide an order of magnitude more galaxies than current surveys.},

	Abstract = {It is argued that the evolution of the universe proceeded from a nearly uniform initial state to a progressively more irregular and clumpy universe. The discussion centers on the clusters of galaxies, the empirical evidence of the nature of clustering, and theories of how the clustering evolves in an expanding universe. A historical introduction to the subject is given; and a survey of methods used to deal with the Newtonian approximation to the theory of the evolution of the mass distribution is presented. Recent progress in the use of statistical measures of the clustering is described; and techniques for dealing with cosmic evolution, in the statistical measures of clustering and under general relativity theory, are considered. An assessment is made of attempts to link theory and observation to arrive at a well-established physical picture of the nature and evolution of the universe.},

@article{Munari:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We present the latest version of Pinocchio, a code that generates catalogues of DM haloes in an approximate but fast way with respect to an N-body simulation. This code version extends the computation of particle and halo displacements up to 3rd-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT), in contrast with previous versions that used Zeldovich approximation (ZA). We run Pinocchio on the same initial configuration of a reference N-body simulation, so that the comparison extends to the object-by-object level. We consider haloes at redshifts 0 and 1, using different LPT orders either for halo construction - where displacements are needed to decide particle accretion onto a halo or halo merging - or to compute halo final positions. We compare the clustering properties of Pinocchio haloes with those from the simulation by computing the power spectrum and 2-point correlation function (2PCF) in real and redshift space (monopole and quadrupole), the bispectrum and the phase difference of halo distributions. We find that 2LPT and 3LPT give noticeable improvement. 3LPT provides the best agreement with N-body when it is used to displace haloes, while 2LPT gives better results for constructing haloes. At the highest orders, linear bias is typically recovered at a few per cent level. In Fourier space and using 3LPT for halo displacements, the halo power spectrum is recovered to within 10 per cent up to $k_{max}\sim0.5\ h/$Mpc. The results presented in this paper have interesting implications for the generation of large ensemble of mock surveys aimed at accurately compute covariance matrices for clustering statistics.},

@article{Sunayama:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Precision measurements of the large scale structure of the Universe require large numbers of high fidelity mock catalogs to accurately assess, and account for, the presence of systematic effects. We introduce and test a scheme for generating mock catalogs rapidly using suitably derated N-body simulations. Our aim is to reproduce the large scale structure and the gross properties of dark matter halos with high accuracy, while sacrificing the details of the halo's internal structure. By adjusting global and local time-steps in an N-body code, we demonstrate that we recover halo masses to better than 0.5% and the power spectrum to better than 1% both in real and redshift space for k=1hMpc-1, while requiring a factor of 4 less CPU time. We also calibrate the redshift spacing of outputs required to generate simulated light cones. We find that outputs separated by Delta z=0.05 allow us to interpolate particle positions and velocities to reproduce the real and redshift space power spectra to better than 1% (out to k=1hMpc-1). We apply these ideas to generate a suite of simulations spanning a range of cosmologies, motivated by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) but broadly applicable to future large scale structure surveys including eBOSS and DESI. As an initial demonstration of the utility of such simulations, we calibrate the shift in the baryonic acoustic oscillation peak position as a function of galaxy bias with higher precision than has been possible so far. This paper also serves to document the simulations, which we make publicly available.},

@article{Chuang:2015aa,
	Abstract = {We present a comparison of major methodologies of fast generating mock halo or galaxy catalogues. The comparison is done for two-point (power spectrum and two-point correlation function in real and redshift space), and the three-point clustering statistics (bispectrum and three-point correlation function). The reference catalogues are drawn from the BigMultiDark N-body simulation. Both friend-of-friends (including distinct haloes only) and spherical overdensity (including distinct haloes and subhalos) catalogues have been used with the typical number density of a large volume galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the power spectrum at quasi-linear and even smaller scales. With respect to various clustering statistics, a methodology based on perturbation theory and a realistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with N-body simulations. However, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum, only the method based on semi-N-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1 per cent level) at small scales, i.e. r < 25 h-1 Mpc or k > 0.15 h Mpc-1. Full N-body solutions will remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the more efficient approximate solvers can reach a few per cent accuracy in terms of clustering statistics at the scales interesting for the large-scale structure analysis. This makes them useful for massive production aimed at covariance studies, to scan large parameter spaces, and to estimate uncertainties in data analysis techniques, such as baryon acoustic oscillation reconstruction, redshift distortion measurements, etc.},

@article{Izard:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Next generation galaxy surveys demand the development of massive ensembles of galaxy mocks to model the observables and their covariances, what is computationally prohibitive using N-body simulations. COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) is a novel method designed to make this feasible by following an approximate dynamics but with up to three orders of magnitude speed-ups when compared to an exact N-body. In this paper, we investigate the optimization of the code parameters in the compromise between computational cost and recovered accuracy in observables such as two-point clustering and halo abundance. We benchmark those observables with a state-of-the-art N-body run, the MICE Grand Challenge simulation. We find that using 40 time-steps linearly spaced since zi ˜ 20, and a force mesh resolution three times finer than that of the number of particles, yields a matter power spectrum within 1 per cent for k ≲ 1 h Mpc-1 and a halo mass function within 5 per cent of those in the N-body. In turn, the halo bias is accurate within 2 per cent for k ≲ 0.7 h Mpc-1 whereas, in redshift space, the halo monopole and quadrupole are within 4 per cent for k ≲ 0.4 h Mpc-1. These results hold for a broad range in redshift (0 < z < 1) and for all halo mass bins investigated (M > 1012.5 h-1 M&sun;). To bring accuracy in clustering to one per cent level we study various methods that re-calibrate halo masses and/or velocities. We thus propose an optimized choice of COLA code parameters as a powerful tool to optimally exploit future galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {Robust measurements based on current large-scale structure surveys require precise knowledge of statistical and systematic errors. This can be obtained from large numbers of realistic mock galaxy catalogues that mimic the observed distribution of galaxies within the survey volume. To this end we present a fast, distributed-memory, planar-parallel code, L-PICOLA, which can be used to generate and evolve a set of initial conditions into a dark matter field much faster than a full non-linear N-Body simulation. Additionally, L-PICOLA has the ability to include primordial non-Gaussianity in the simulation and simulate the past lightcone at run-time, with optional replication of the simulation volume. Through comparisons to fully non-linear N-Body simulations we find that our code can reproduce the z = 0 power spectrum and reduced bispectrum of dark matter to within 2% and 5% respectively on all scales of interest to measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift Space Distortions, but 3 orders of magnitude faster. The accuracy, speed and scalability of this code, alongside the additional features we have implemented, make it extremely useful for both current and next generation large-scale structure surveys. L-PICOLA is publicly available at https://cullanhowlett.github.io/l-picola.},

@article{Carretero:2015aa,
	Abstract = {We present a method to build mock galaxy catalogues starting from a halo catalogue that uses halo occupation distribution (HOD) recipes as well as the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique. Combining both prescriptions we are able to push the absolute magnitude of the resulting catalogue to fainter luminosities than using just the SHAM technique and can interpret our results in terms of the HOD modelling. We optimize the method by populating with galaxies friends-of-friends dark matter haloes extracted from the Marenostrum Institut de Ci{\`e}ncies de l'Espai dark matter simulations and comparing them to observational constraints. Our resulting mock galaxy catalogues manage to reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity function and the colour-magnitude distribution as observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. They also reproduce the observed galaxy clustering properties as a function of luminosity and colour. In order to achieve that, the algorithm also includes scatter in the halo mass-galaxy luminosity relation derived from direct SHAM and a modified Navarro-Frenk-White mass density profile to place satellite galaxies in their host dark matter haloes. Improving on general usage of the HOD that fits the clustering for given magnitude limited samples, our catalogues are constructed to fit observations at all luminosities considered and therefore for any luminosity subsample. Overall, our algorithm is an economic procedure of obtaining galaxy mock catalogues down to faint magnitudes that are necessary to understand and interpret galaxy surveys.},

@article{Tassev:2015aa,
	Abstract = {We present sCOLA -- an extension of the N-body COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to the spatial domain. Similar to the original temporal-domain COLA, sCOLA is an N-body method for solving for large-scale structure in a frame that is comoving with observers following trajectories calculated in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. Incorporating the sCOLA method in an N-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing the gravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, while letting the N-body code solve only for the near field. The far and near fields are completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the N-body side of the code. Thus, running an N-body code for a small simulation volume using sCOLA can reproduce the results of a standard N-body run for the same small volume embedded inside a much larger simulation. We demonstrate that sCOLA can be safely combined with the original temporal-domain COLA. sCOLA can be used as a method for performing zoom-in simulations. It also allows N-body codes to be made embarrassingly parallel, thus allowing for efficiently tiling a volume of interest using grid computing. Moreover, sCOLA can be useful for cheaply generating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to study galaxy clustering. Surveys that will benefit the most are ones with large aspect ratios, such as pencil-beam surveys, where sCOLA can easily capture the effects of large-scale transverse modes without the need to substantially increase the simulated volume. As an illustration of the method, we present proof-of-concept zoom-in simulations using a freely available sCOLA-based N-body code.},

	Abstract = {We present a new parallel implementation of the PINpointing Orbit Crossing-Collapsed HIerarchical Objects (PINOCCHIO) algorithm, a quick tool, based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, for the hierarchical build-up of dark matter (DM) haloes in cosmological volumes. To assess its ability to predict halo correlations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an N-body simulation of a 3 h-1 Gpc box sampled with 20483 particles taken from the MICE suite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. Thanks to the Fastest Fourier Transforms in the West (FFTW) libraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scaling properties. The CPU time required by PINOCCHIO is a tiny fraction (˜1/2000) of that required by the MICE simulation. Varying some of PINOCCHIO numerical parameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in the range allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the MICE mass function of Friends-of-Friends (FoF) haloes in the high-mass tail. We compare the matter-halo and the halo-halo power spectra with those of the MICE simulation and find that these two-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. In particular, when catalogues are matched in number density, agreement within 10 per cent is achieved for the halo power spectrum. At scales k > 0.1 h Mpc-1, the inaccuracy of the Zel'dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimate of the power spectrum that can be modelled as a Gaussian factor with a damping scale of d = 3 h-1 Mpc at z = 0, decreasing at higher redshift. Finally, a remarkable match is obtained for the reduced halo bispectrum, showing a good description of non-linear halo bias. Our results demonstrate the potential of PINOCCHIO as an accurate and flexible tool for generating large ensembles of mock galaxy surveys, with interesting applications for the analysis of large galaxy redshift surveys.},

The radial selection functions and geometrical limits of the catalogues mimic those of the genuine surveys. The catalogues span a wide range of cosmologies, including both open and flat universes. In all the models the galaxy distributions are biased so as approximately to reproduce the observed galaxy correlation function on scales of 1-10h^-1Mpc. In some cases models with a variety of different biasing prescriptions are included. All the mock catalogues are publicly available at http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/&tildecole/mocks/main.html. We expect these catalogues to be a valuable aid in the development of the new algorithms and statistics that will be used to analyse the 2dF and SDSS surveys when they are completed in the next few years. Mock catalogues of the PSCz survey of IRAS galaxies are also available at the same World Wide Web location.},

	Abstract = {We explore the cosmological implications of anisotropic clustering measurements in configuration space of the final galaxy samples from Data Release 12 of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We implement a new detailed modelling of the effects of non-linearities, galaxy bias and redshift-space distortions that can be used to extract unbiased cosmological information from our measurements for scales $s \gtrsim 20\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We combined the galaxy clustering information from BOSS with the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and Type Ia supernovae samples and found no significant evidence for a deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. In particular, these data sets can constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter to $w_{\rm DE}=-0.996\pm0.042$ when assumed time-independent, the curvature of the Universe to $\Omega_{k}=-0.0007\pm 0.0030$ and the sum of the neutrino masses to $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.25\,{\rm eV}$ at 95 per cent CL. We explore the constraints on the growth rate of cosmic structures assuming $f(z)=\Omega_{\rm m}(z)^\gamma$ and obtain $\gamma = 0.609\pm 0.079$, in good agreement with the predictions of general relativity of $\gamma=0.55$. We compress the information of our clustering measurements into constraints on the parameter combinations $D_{\rm V}(z)/r_{\rm d}$, $F_{\rm AP}(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$ at the effective redshifts of $z=0.38$, $0.51$ and $0.61$ with their respective covariance matrices and find good agreement with the predictions for these parameters obtained from the best-fitting $\Lambda$CDM model to the CMB data from the Planck satellite. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al. (2016) to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical modeling of the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies is crucially important to correctly extract cosmological information from galaxy redshift surveys. The task is complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects, which change with halo mass, and by the wide distribution of halo masses and their occupations by galaxies. One of the main modeling challenges is the existence of satellite galaxies that have both radial distribution inside the halos and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon known as the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect. We present a model for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies in which we decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxies and relate different contributions to the power spectrum to 1-halo and 2-halo terms in a halo model. Our primary goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have physically meaningful values, and are not just fitting parameters. For the lowest order 2-halo terms we use the previously developed RSD modeling of halos in the context of distribution function and perturbation theory approach. This term needs to be multiplied by the effect of radial distances and velocities of satellites inside the halo. To this one needs to add the 1-halo terms, which are nonperturbative. We show that the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled as almost constant, with the finite extent of the satellites inside the halo inducing a small k2R2 term over the range of scales of interest, where R is related to the size of the halo given by its halo mass. We adopt a similar model for FoG in redshift space, ensuring that FoG velocity dispersion is related to the halo mass. For FoG k2 type expansions do not work over the range of scales of interest and FoG resummation must be used instead. We test several simple damping functions to model the velocity dispersion FoG effect. Applying the formalism to mock galaxies modeled after the "CMASS" sample of the BOSS survey, we find that our predictions for the redshift-space power spectra are accurate up to k ~=0.4 h Mpc-1 within 1% if the halo power spectrum is measured using N -body simulations and within 3% if it is modeled using perturbation theory.},

	Abstract = {Redshift-space distortions (RSDs) offer an attractive method to measure the growth of cosmic structure on large scales, and combining with the measurement of the cosmic expansion history, they can be used as cosmological tests of gravity. With the advent of future galaxy redshift surveys aiming at precisely measuring the RSD, an accurate modeling of RSD going beyond linear theory is a critical issue in order to detect or disprove small deviations from general relativity (GR). While several improved models of RSD have been recently proposed based on the perturbation theory (PT), the framework of these models heavily relies on GR. Here, we put forward a new PT prescription for RSD in general modified gravity models. As a specific application, we present theoretical predictions of the redshift-space power spectra in the f(R) gravity model, and compare them with N-body simulations. Using the PT template that takes into account the effects of both modifications of gravity and RSD properly, we successfully recover the fiducial model parameter in N-body simulations in an unbiased way. On the other hand, we found it difficult to detect the scale dependence of the growth rate in a model-independent way based on GR templates.},

	Abstract = {Using a full implementation of resummed perturbation theory (PT) from a multipoint propagator expansion, we put forward new theoretical predictions for the two-point statistics of matter fluctuations in redshift space. The predictions consistently include PT corrections up to the two-loop order and are based on an improved prescription of the redshift-space distortions that properly takes into account their non-Gaussian impact from a systematic low-k expansion. In contrast to the previous studies that partly used standard PT calculations, the present treatment is able to provide a consistent prediction for both power spectra and correlation functions. These results are compared with N-body simulations with which a very good agreement is found up to the quadrupole moment. However, the theoretical predictions for the hexadecapole moment of the power spectra are found to significantly depart from the numerical results at low redshift. We examine this issue and find it to be likely related to an improper modeling of the redshift-space distortions damping effects on which this moment shows large dependence.},

@article{Okumura:2012aa,
	Abstract = {It was recently shown that the power spectrum in redshift space can be written as a sum of cross-power spectra between number weighted velocity moments, of which the lowest are density and momentum density. We investigate numerically the properties of these power spectra for simulated galaxies and dark matter halos and compare them to the dark matter power spectra, generalizing the concept of the bias in density-density power spectra. Because all of the quantities are number weighted this approach is well defined even for sparse systems such as massive halos. This contrasts to the previous approaches to RSD where velocity correlations have been explored, but velocity field is a poorly defined concept for sparse systems. We find that the number density weighting leads to a strong scale dependence of the bias terms for momentum density auto-correlation and cross-correlation with density. This trend becomes more significant for the more biased halos and leads to an enhancement of RSD power relative to the linear theory. Fingers-of-god effects, which in this formalism come from the correlations of the higher order moments beyond the momentum density, lead to smoothing of the power spectrum and can reduce this enhancement of power from the scale dependent bias, but are relatively small for halos with no small scale velocity dispersion. In comparison, for a more realistic galaxy sample with satellites the small scale velocity dispersion generated by satellite motions inside the halos leads to a larger power suppression on small scales, but this depends on the satellite fraction and on the details of how the satellites are distributed inside the halo. We investigate several statistics such as the two-dimensional power spectrum P(k,mu), where mu is the angle between the Fourier mode and line of sight, its multipole moments, its powers of mu2, and configuration space statistics. Overall we find that the nonlinear effects in realistic galaxy samples such as luminous red galaxies affect the redshift space clustering on very large scales: for example, the quadrupole moment is affected by 10% for k < 0.1hMpc-1, which means that these effects need to be understood if we want to extract cosmological information from the redshift space distortions.},

	Abstract = {Understanding a behavior of galaxy biasing is crucial for future galaxy redshift surveys. One aim is to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) within the precision of a few percent level. Using 30 large cosmological N-body simulations for a standard LambdaCDM cosmology, we study the halo biasing over a wide redshift range. We compare the simulation results with theoretical predictions proposed by Matsubara [T. Matsubara, Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ1550-7998 78, 083519 (2008).10.1103/PhysRevD.78.083519] which naturally incorporate the halo bias and redshift-space distortions into their formalism of perturbation theory with a resummation technique via the Lagrangian picture. The power spectrum and correlation function of halos obtained from Lagrangian resummation theory (LRT) well agree with N-body simulation results on scales of BAOs. Especially nonlinear effects on the baryon acoustic peak of the halo correlation function are accurately explained both in real and redshift space. We find that nonlinearity and scale dependence of bias are fairly well reproduced by 1-loop LRT up to k=0.35hMpc-1 (z=2 and 3) within a few percent level in real space and up to k=0.1hMpc-1 (z=2) and 0.15hMpc-1 (z=3) in redshift space. Thus, the LRT is very powerful for accurately extracting cosmological information in upcoming high redshift BAO surveys.},

	Abstract = {We extract cosmological information from the anisotropic power spectrum measurements from the recently completed Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), extending the concept of clustering wedges to Fourier space. Making use of new FFT-based estimators, we measure the power spectrum clustering wedges of the BOSS sample by filtering out the information of Legendre multipoles l > 4. Our modelling of these measurements is based on novel approaches to describe non-linear evolution, bias, and redshift-space distortions, which we test using synthetic catalogues based on large-volume N-body simulations. We are able to include smaller scales than in previous analyses, resulting in tighter cosmological constraints. Using three overlapping redshift bins, we measure the angular diameter distance, the Hubble parameter, and the cosmic growth rate, and explore the cosmological implications of our full shape clustering measurements in combination with CMB and SN Ia data. Assuming a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, we constrain the matter density to {\Omega}_m = 0.311 -0.010 +0.009 and the Hubble parameter to H_0 = 67.6 -0.6 +0.7 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, at a confidence level (CL) of 68 per cent. We also allow for non-standard dark energy models and modifications of the growth rate, finding good agreement with the {\Lambda}CDM paradigm. For example, we constrain the equation-of-state parameter to w = -1.019 -0.039 +0.048. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al. 2016 to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

	Abstract = {We examine the cosmological implications of the measurements of the linear growth rate of cosmological structure obtained in a companion paper from the power spectrum and bispectrum monopoles of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 11, CMASS galaxies. This measurement was of f 0.43sigma8, where sigma8 is the amplitude of dark matter density fluctuations, and f is the linear growth rate, at the effective redshift of the survey, zeff = 0.57. In conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, interesting constraints can be placed on models with non-standard neutrino properties and models where gravity deviates from General Relativity on cosmological scales. In particular, the sum of the masses of the three species of the neutrinos is constrained to mnu < 0.49 eV (at 95 per cent confidence level) when the f 0.43sigma8 measurement is combined with state-of-the-art CMB measurements. Allowing the effective number of neutrinos to vary as a free parameter does not significantly change these results. When we combine the measurement of f 0.43sigma8 with the complementary measurement of fsigma8 from the monopole and quadrupole of the two-point correlation function, we are able to obtain an independent measurements of f and sigma8. We obtain f = 0.63 $\pm$ 0.16 and sigma8 = 0.710 $\pm$ 0.086 (68 per cent confidence level). This is the first time when these parameters have been able to be measured independently using the redshift-space power spectrum and bispectrum measurements from galaxy clustering data only.},

	Abstract = {We measure and analyse the bispectrum of the final, Data Release 12, galaxy sample provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, splitting by selection algorithm into LOWZ and CMASS galaxies. The LOWZ sample contains 361762 galaxies with an effective redshift of $z_{\rm LOWZ}=0.32$, and the CMASS sample 777202 galaxies with an effective redshift of $z_{\rm CMASS}=0.57$. Combining the power spectrum, measured relative to the line-of-sight, with the spherically averaged bispectrum, we are able to constrain the product of the growth of structure parameter, $f$, and the amplitude of dark matter density fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, along with the geometric Alcock-Paczynski parameters, the product of the Hubble constant and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch, $H(z)r_s(z_d)$, and the angular distance parameter divided by the sound horizon, $D_A(z)/r_s(z_d)$. We find $f(z_{\rm LOWZ})\sigma_8(z_{\rm LOWZ})=0.460\pm 0.066$, $D_A(z_{\rm LOWZ})/r_s(z_d)=6.74 \pm 0.22$, $H(z_{\rm LOWZ})r_s(z_d)=(11.75\pm 0.55)10^3\,{\rm kms}^{-1}$ for the LOWZ sample, and $f(z_{\rm CMASS})\sigma_8(z_{\rm CMASS})=0.417\pm 0.027$, $D_A(z_{\rm CMASS})/r_s(z_d)=9.33 \pm 0.15$, $H(z_{\rm CMASS})r_s(z_d)=(13.78\pm 0.28)10^3\,{\rm kms}^{-1}$ for the CMASS sample. We find general agreement with previous BOSS DR11 and DR12 measurements. Combining our dataset with Planck we perform a null test of General Relativity (GR) through the $\gamma$-parametrisation finding $\gamma=0.719^{+0.080}_{-0.072}$, which reveals a $\sim2.5\sigma$ tension with the GR predictions. We ensure that our measurements are robust by performing detailed systematic tests using a suite of survey galaxy mock catalogs and $N$-body simulations.},

The LOWZ sample contains 361 762 galaxies with an effective redshift of zlowz = 0.32, and the CMASS sample 777 202 galaxies with an effective redshift of zcmass = 0.57. From the power spectrum monopole and quadrupole moments around the LOS, we measure the growth of structure parameter f times the amplitude of dark matter density fluctuations sigma8 by modelling the redshift-space distortion signal. When the geometrical Alcock-Paczynski effect is also constrained from the same data, we find joint constraints on fsigma8, the product of the Hubble constant and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch H(z)rs(zd), and the angular distance parameter divided by the sound horizon DA(z)/rs(zd). We find f(zlowz)sigma8(zlowz) = 0.394 $\pm$ 0.062, DA(zlowz)/rs(zd) = 6.35 $\pm$ 0.19, H(zlowz)rs(zd) = (11.41 $\pm$ 0.56) 103 km s- 1 for the LOWZ sample, and f(zcmass)sigma8(zcmass) = 0.444 $\pm$ 0.038, DA(zcmass)/rs(zd) = 9.42 $\pm$ 0.15, H(zcmass)rs(zd) = (13.92 $\pm$ 0.44) 103 km s- 1 for the CMASS sample.

	Abstract = {We investigate the anisotropic clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) sample, which consists of $1\,198\,006$ galaxies in the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.75$ and a sky coverage of $10\,252\,$deg$^2$. We analyse this dataset in Fourier space, using the power spectrum multipoles to measure Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD) simultaneously with the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale. We include the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole in our analysis and compare our measurements with a perturbation theory based model, while properly accounting for the survey window function. To evaluate the reliability of our analysis pipeline we participate in a mock challenge, which resulted in systematic uncertainties significantly smaller than the statistical uncertainties. While the high-redshift constraint on $f\sigma_8$ at $z_{\rm eff}=0.61$ indicates a small ($\sim 1.4\sigma$) deviation from the prediction of the Planck $\Lambda$CDM model, the low-redshift constraint is in good agreement with Planck $\Lambda$CDM. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS.

	Abstract = {We measure the sum of the neutrino particle masses using the three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 9 the constant MASS (CMASS) galaxy sample. Combined with the cosmic microwave background, supernova and additional baryonic acoustic oscillation data, we find upper 95 per cent confidence limits (CL) of the neutrino mass Sigmamnu < 0.340 eV within a flat Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) background, and Sigmamnu < 0.821 eV, assuming a more general background cosmological model. The number of neutrino species is measured to be Neff = 4.308 $\pm$ 0.794 and 4.032^{+0.870}_{-0.894} for these two cases, respectively. We study and quantify the effect of several factors on the neutrino measurements, including the galaxy power spectrum bias model, the effect of redshift-space distortion, the cut-off scale of the power spectrum and the choice of additional data. The impact of neutrinos with unknown masses on other cosmological parameter measurements is investigated. The fractional matter density and the Hubble parameter are measured to be Omega _M=0.2796$\pm$ 0.0097, H_0=69.72^{+0.90}_{-0.91} km s-1 Mpc-1 (flat LambdaCDM) and Omega _M=0.2798^{+0.0132}_{-0.0136}, H_0=73.78^{+3.16}_{-3.17} km s-1 Mpc-1 (more general background model). Based on a Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization of the equation-of-state w of dark energy, we find that w = -1 is consistent with observations, even allowing for neutrinos. Similarly, the curvature OmegaK and the running of the spectral index alphas are both consistent with zero. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is constrained down to r < 0.198 (95 per cent CL, flat LambdaCDM) and r < 0.440 (95 per cent CL, more general background model).},

	Abstract = {We analyse the density field of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) included in the SDSS Data Release Nine (DR9). DR9 includes spectroscopic redshifts for over 400 000 galaxies spread over a footprint of 3275 deg2. We identify, characterize and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty on large-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of the redshift-space correlation function, xil(s), and the spherically averaged power spectrum, P(k), in order to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will be obtained from these data. A correlation between the projected density of stars and the higher redshift (0.43 < z < 0.7) galaxy sample (the approximately constant stellar mass threshold 'CMASS' sample) due to imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than the statistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s > 120 h-1 Mpc or k < 0.01 h Mpc-1. We find that these errors can be ameliorated by weighting galaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar density. The clustering of CMASS galaxies found in the Northern and Southern Galactic footprints of the survey generally agrees to within 2sigma. We use mock galaxy catalogues that simulate the CMASS selection function to determine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in order to simulate the radial selection function of a random sample imparts the least systematic error on xil(s) measurements and that this systematic error is negligible for the spherically averaged correlation function, xi0. We find a peak in xi0 at s˜ 200 h-1 Mpc, with a corresponding feature with period ˜0.03 h Mpc-1 in P(k), and find features at least as strong in 4.8 per cent of the mock galaxy catalogues, concluding this feature is likely to be a consequence of cosmic variance. The methods we recommend for the calculation of clustering measurements using the CMASS sample are adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, constrain cosmological models using the full shape of xi0 and measure the rate of structure growth.},

	Abstract = {The Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a massively multiplexed fiber-fed optical and near-infrared three-arm spectrograph (Nfiber = 2400, 380 <= lambda <= 1260 nm, 1 .^{circ}3 diameter field of view). Here, we summarize the science cases in terms of provisional plans for a 300-night Subaru survey. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via a survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3 h-3 Gpc3 in the redshift range 0.8 < z < 2.4. In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be measured to 3% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth to 6% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 106 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams as faint as V ˜ 22, including stars with V < 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple alpha-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic stars. For the galaxy evolution program, our simulations suggest the wide wavelength range of PFS will be powerful in probing the galaxy population and its clustering over a wide redshift range. We plan to conduct a color-selected survey of 1 < z < 2 galaxies and AGN over 16 deg2 to J ~= 23.4, yielding a fair sample of galaxies with stellar masses above ˜1010 M&sun; at z ~= 2. A two-tiered survey of higher redshift Lyman break galaxies and Lyman alpha emitters will quantify the properties of early systems close to the reionization epoch.},

	Abstract = {We present distance scale measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillation signal in the constant stellar mass and low-redshift sample samples from the Data Release 12 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. The total volume probed is 14.5 Gpc3, a 10 per cent increment from Data Release 11. From an analysis of the spherically averaged correlation function, we infer a distance to z = 0.57 of D_V(z)r^fid_d/r_d = 2028$\pm$ 21 Mpc and a distance to z = 0.32 of D_V(z)r^fid_d/r_d = 1264$\pm$ 22 Mpc assuming a cosmology in which r^fid_d = 147.10 Mpc. From the anisotropic analysis, we find an angular diameter distance to z = 0.57 of D_A(z)r^fid_d/r_d = 1401$\pm$ 21 Mpc and a distance to z = 0.32 of 981 $\pm$ 20 Mpc, a 1.5 and 2.0 per cent measurement, respectively. The Hubble parameter at z = 0.57 is H(z)r_d/r^fid_d = 100.3$\pm$ 3.7 km s-1 Mpc-1 and its value at z = 0.32 is 79.2 $\pm$ 5.6 km s-1 Mpc-1, a 3.7 and 7.1 per cent measurement, respectively. These cosmic distance scale constraints are in excellent agreement with a Lambda cold dark matter model with cosmological parameters released by the recent Planck 2015 results.},

	Abstract = {We present a set of mock redshift catalogs, constructed from N-body simulations, designed to mimic the DEEP2 survey. Galaxies with a range of luminosities are placed within virialized halos in the simulation using a variant of the halo model. The halo model parameters are chosen to reproduce local clustering and abundance data and are assumed to be independent of redshift. This allows us to predict the luminosity function, two-point correlation function, luminosity- and scale-dependent bias, redshift space distortions, and so on, of our galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that the low-order clustering properties are consistent with preliminary DEEP2 data. The catalogs can be used to evaluate the selection effects of the survey and to test new algorithms and statistics that are to be used in the analysis of DEEP2 data.},

	Abstract = {We reproduce the galaxy clustering catalogue from the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Final Data Release (BOSS DR11&DR12) with high fidelity on all relevant scales in order to allow a robust analysis of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions. We have generated (6000) 12 288 MultiDark PATCHY BOSS (DR11) DR12 light cones corresponding to an effective volume of ˜192 000 [h-1 Gpc]3 (the largest ever simulated volume), including cosmic evolution in the redshift range from 0.15 to 0.75. The mocks have been calibrated using a reference galaxy catalogue based on the halo abundance matching modelling of the BOSS DR11&DR12 galaxy clustering data and on the data themselves. The production follows three steps. First, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field and an object distribution including non-linear stochastic galaxy bias. Secondly, we run the halo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON code to assign masses to the various objects. This step uses the mass distribution as a function of local density and non-local indicators (i.e. tidal field tensor eigenvalues and relative halo exclusion separation for massive objects) from the reference simulation applied to the corresponding patchy dark matter and galaxy distribution. Finally, we apply the SUGAR code to build the light cones. The resulting MultiDarkPATCHY mock light cones reproduce the number density, selection function, survey geometry, and in general within 1sigma, for arbitrary stellar mass bins, the power spectrum up to k = 0.3 h Mpc-1, the two-point correlation functions down to a few Mpc scales, and the three-point statistics of the BOSS DR11&DR12 galaxy samples.},

@article{Zehavi:2011aa,
	Abstract = {We measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the largest-ever galaxy redshift survey, the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data Release. We focus on the projected correlation function wp (rp ) of volume-limited samples, extracted from the parent sample of ~700,000 galaxies over 8000 deg2, extending up to redshift of 0.25. We interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a LambdaCDM cosmology (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). The amplitude of wp (rp ) grows slowly with luminosity for L < L * and increases sharply at higher luminosities, with a large-scale bias factor b(> L) × (sigma8/0.8) = 1.06 + 0.21(L/L *)1.12, where L is the sample luminosity threshold. At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function, a steady trend that runs through the "blue cloud" and "green valley" and continues across the "red sequence." The cross-correlation of red and blue galaxies is close to the geometric mean of their autocorrelations, dropping slightly below at rp < 1 h -1 Mpc. The luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations separately are strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of clustering strength with luminosity, with nearly constant shape of wp (rp ). The large-scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L > 4 L *, but the lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L *) show very strong clustering on small scales (rp < 2 h -1 Mpc). Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the LambdaCDM+HOD framework. The growth of wp (rp ) for higher luminosity galaxies reflects an overall shift in the mass scale of their host dark matter halos, in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass M min. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M 1 ≈ 17 M min(L) over most of the luminosity range, with a smaller ratio above L *. The growth and steepening of wp (rp ) for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high-mass halos instead of central systems in low-mass halos, a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in tabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy formation, a firm grounding of semiempirical models of the galaxy population, and new constraints on cosmological parameters from combining real-space galaxy clustering with mass-sensitive statistics such as redshift-space distortions, cluster mass-to-light ratios, and galaxy-galaxy lensing.},

	Abstract = {We calculate stellar masses for ˜400 000 massive luminous galaxies at redshift ˜0.2-0.7 using the first two years of data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energy distributions to u, g, r, i, z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies are used to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. Accurate BOSS spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. We find that the distribution of stellar masses in BOSS is narrow (Deltalog M ˜ 0.5 dex) and peaks at about log M/M&sun; ˜ 11.3 (for a Kroupa initial stellar mass function), and that the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2-0.6, in agreement with the intended BOSS target selection. The galaxy masses probed by BOSS extend over ˜1012 M&sun;, providing unprecedented measurements of the high-mass end of the galaxy mass function. We find that the galaxy number density above ˜2.5 × 1011 M&sun; agrees with previous determinations. We perform a comparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS target selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance of massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the BOSS data, but the models lack galaxies at the massive end. Moreover, no evolution with redshift is detected from ˜0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance of massive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. Additionally, BOSS data display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the local Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other hand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a narrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the lack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly due to metallicity, which is too low in the models.},

	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying dark matter halos, substructure, and tidal features. The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named ROCKSTAR (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations (>1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown ROCKSTAR to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

	Abstract = {Accurately predicting structural properties of dark matter halos is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the new suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. The MultiDark simulations cover a large range of masses 1e10-1e15Msun and volumes upto 50Gpc**3. The total number of dark matter halos in all the simulations exceeds 60 billion. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter halos and to make ~1% accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the traditional ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the NFW profile. For massive halos the averge density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter alpha in the Einasto approximation. Combining results from different redshifts, masses and cosmologies, we show that halos progress through three stages of evolution. (1) They start as rare density peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial infall. This radial infall brings mass closer to the center producing a high concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with the increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the alpha parameter with nearly constant core radius. Later halos slide into (2) the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. Now the concentration does not depend on halo mass. (3) Once the rate of accretion slows down, halos move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. We provide accurate analytical fits to the numerical results for halo density profiles and concentrations.},

@article{Taruya:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We present an improved prescription for the matter power spectrum in redshift space taking proper account of both nonlinear gravitational clustering and redshift distortion, which are of particular importance for accurately modeling baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Contrary to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the literature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the nonlinear coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with the monopole and quadrupole power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are also investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism, particularly focusing on the measurements of the Hubble parameter, angular diameter distance, and growth rate for structure formation. We find that the existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter by 1%-2% , and the growth-rate parameter by ˜5%, which would become non-negligible for future galaxy surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and the new prescription for the redshift-space power spectrum including the nonlinear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic BAOs.},

	Abstract = {We present a specific prescription for the calculation of cosmological power spectra, exploited here at two-loop order in perturbation theory, based on the multipoint propagator expansion. In this approach, density and velocity power spectra are constructed from the regularized expressions of the propagators that reproduce both the resummed behavior in the high-k limit and the standard perturbation theory results at low k. With the help of N-body simulations, we particularly focus on the density field, and show that such a construction gives robust and accurate predictions for both the density power spectrum and the correlation function at percent level in the weakly nonlinear regime. We then present an algorithm that allows accelerated evaluations of all the required diagrams by reducing the computational tasks to one-dimensional integrals. This is achieved by means of precomputed kernel sets defined for appropriately chosen fiducial models. The computational time for two-loop results is then reduced from a few minutes, with the direct method, to a few seconds with the fast one. The robustness and applicability of this method are tested against the power spectrum cosmic emulator from which a wide variety of cosmological models can be explored. The Fortran program with which direct and fast calculations of density power spectra can be done, RegPT, is publicly released as part of this paper.},

	Abstract = {Redshift-space distortions in galaxy surveys happen along the radial direction, breaking statistical translation invariance. We construct estimators for radial distortions that, using only fast fourier transforms (FFTs) of the overdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. the BOSS survey requires about 3 min for l=0 ,2 ,4 power spectra for scales up to k =0.3 h Mpc-1 and about 15 additional min for l=0 ,2 ,4 bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to k =0.2 h Mpc-1 on a single core. The speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible for one to compute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogs with realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improved constraints of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.},

	Abstract = {The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1% when combined with the z>0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ~195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 3.1% and H(z) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9<z<2.2, with expected precision of 2.8% and 4.2% on $d_A(z)$ and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new Lyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z>2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of $d_A(z)$ and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide new tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, new tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

	Abstract = {Current and upcoming cosmological observations allow us to probe structures on smaller and smaller scales, entering highly nonlinear regimes. In order to obtain theoretical predictions in these regimes, large cosmological simulations have to be carried out. The promised high accuracy from observations makes the simulation task very demanding: the simulations have to be at least as accurate as the observations. This requirement can only be fulfilled by carrying out an extensive code verification program. The first step of such a program is the comparison of different cosmology codes including gravitational interactions only. In this paper, we extend a recently carried out code comparison project to include five more simulation codes. We restrict our analysis to a small cosmological volume which allows us to investigate properties of halos. For the matter power spectrum and the mass function, the previous results hold, with the codes agreeing at the 10% level over wide dynamic ranges. We extend our analysis to the comparison of halo profiles and investigate the halo count as a function of local density. We introduce and discuss ParaView as a flexible analysis tool for cosmological simulations, the use of which immensely simplifies the code comparison task.},

	Abstract = {Future galaxy surveys require one percent precision in the theoretical knowledge of the power spectrum over a large range including very nonlinear scales. While this level of accuracy is easily obtained in the linear regime with perturbation theory, it represents a serious challenge for small scales where numerical simulations are required. In this paper we quantify the accuracy of present-day $N$-body methods, identifying main potential error sources from the set-up of initial conditions to the measurement of the final power spectrum. We directly compare three widely used $N$-body codes, Ramses, Pkdgrav3, and Gadget3 which represent three main discretisation techniques: the particle-mesh method, the tree method, and a hybrid combination of the two. For standard run parameters, the codes agree to within one percent at $k\leq1$ $h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and to within three percent at $k\leq10$ $h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$. In a second step, we quantify potential errors due to initial conditions, box size, and resolution using an extended suite of simulations performed with our fastest code {\tt Pkdgrav3}. We demonstrate that both a minimum box size of $L=500$ $h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ and a maximum particle mass of $M_{\rm p}=10^{9}$ $h^{-1}\rm M_{\odot}$ are required to obtain one percent precision of the matter power spectrum. As a consequence, numerical simulations covering large survey volumes of upcoming missions such as DES, LSST, and Euclid will need more than a trillion particles to reproduce clustering properties at the targeted accuracy.},

	Abstract = {We study the abundance of clusters in the LasDamas suite of cosmological N-body simulations. These simulations contain an unprecedented volume (750 Gpc3/h3) and are seeded with initial conditions using second order lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) instead of the standard Zel'Dovich approximation (ZA). Recent results show that ZA leads to unphysical transients that predominantly inhibit the collapse of the earliest forming density peaks such as massive halos of galaxy clusters. We compare our results to simulations seeded with ZA, but using the same starting redshift, cosmology, simulation parameters, and phases. We find a significant systematic bias in the number density of clusters that grows with both halo mass and redshift. For masses greater than 2e14 Msun/h, we find that ZA underpredicts the abundance of halos by 3% at z=0 and 15% at z=1. For masses greater than 5e14 Msun/h, these rise to 5% and 20%, respectively. We show that this bias is only partially mitigated by using ZA with a higher starting redshift. We demonstrate the effect on cluster abundance persists regardless of halo defintion, quantifying the effect for both spherical overdensity and friends-of-friends halos. If unaccounted for, this bias can lead to inaccurate cosmological constraints on dark energy, or be misinterpreted as primordial non-Gaussianity.},

	Abstract = {We present a fast method for producing mock galaxy catalogues that can be used to compute the covariance of large-scale clustering measurements and test analysis techniques. Our method populates a second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) matter field, where we calibrate masses of dark matter haloes by detailed comparisons with N-body simulations. We demonstrate that the clustering of haloes is recovered at ˜10 per cent accuracy. We populate haloes with mock galaxies using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescription, which has been calibrated to reproduce the clustering measurements on scales between 30 and 80 h-1 Mpc. We compare the sample covariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discuss differences. We have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to Data Release 9 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), producing 600 mock catalogues of the `CMASS' galaxy sample. These mocks have enabled detailed tests of methods and errors, and have formed an integral part of companion analyses of these galaxy data.},

@article{Zehavi:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We study the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, starting from a sample of ~200,000 galaxies over 2500 deg2. We concentrate our analysis on volume-limited subsamples of specified luminosity ranges, for which we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp), which is directly related to the real-space correlation function xi(r). The amplitude of wp(rp) rises continuously with luminosity from Mr~-17.5 to Mr~-22.5, with the most rapid increase occurring above the characteristic luminosity L* (Mr~-20.5). Over the scales 0.1 h-1 Mpc<rp<10 h-1 Mpc, the measurements for samples with Mr>-22 can be approximated, imperfectly, by power-law three-dimensional correlation functions xi(r)=(r/r0)-gamma with gamma~1.8 and r0(L*)~5.0 h-1 Mpc. The brightest subsample, -23<Mr<-22, has a significantly steeper xi(r). When we divide samples by color, redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation amplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the luminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red galaxies exhibiting the strongest clustering at large scales and faint red galaxies exhibiting the strongest clustering at small scales. We interpret these results using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models assuming concordance cosmological parameters. For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits the wp(rp) data better than a power law, explaining inflections at rp~1-3 h-1 Mpc as the transition between the one-halo and two-halo regimes of xi(r). The implied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy more luminous than L grows steadily, with Mmin~L at low luminosities and a steeper dependence above L*. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M1~23Mmin(L), at all luminosities. These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at fixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function extrapolation of the satellite population. The HOD model fits nicely explain the color dependence of wp(rp) and the cross correlation between red and blue galaxies. For galaxies with Mr<-21, halos slightly above Mmin have blue central galaxies, while more massive halos have red central galaxies and predominantly red satellite populations. The fraction of blue central galaxies increases steadily with decreasing luminosity and host halo mass. The strong clustering of faint red galaxies follows from the fact that nearly all of them are satellite systems in high-mass halos. The HOD fitting results are in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of numerical and semianalytic models of galaxy formation.},

@article{Berlind:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We identify galaxy groups and clusters in volume-limited samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift survey, using a redshift-space friends-of-friends algorithm. We optimize the friends-of-friends linking lengths to recover galaxy systems that occupy the same dark matter halos, using a set of mock catalogs created by populating halos of N-body simulations with galaxies. Extensive tests with these mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sight linking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneously recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, and velocity dispersion. We adopt a linking length combination that yields, for galaxy groups with 10 or more members: a group multiplicity function that is unbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiased median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated halos; a spurious group fraction of less than ~1% a halo completeness of more than ~97% the correct projected size distribution as a function of multiplicity; and a velocity dispersion distribution that is ~20% too low at all multiplicities. These results hold over a range of mock catalogs that use different input recipes of populating halos with galaxies. We apply our group-finding algorithm to the SDSS data and obtain three group and cluster catalogs for three volume-limited samples that cover 3495.1 deg2 on the sky, go out to redshifts of 0.1, 0.068, and 0.045, and contain 57,138, 37,820, and 18,895 galaxies, respectively. We correct for incompleteness caused by fiber collisions and survey edges and obtain measurements of the group multiplicity function, with errors calculated from realistic mock catalogs. These multiplicity function measurements provide a key constraint on the relation between galaxy populations and dark matter halos.},

@article{Dawson:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000 deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z < 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyalpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g < 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 < z < 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyalpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0% at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyalpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z ~ 2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

	Abstract = {BigBOSS is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey over 14,000 square degrees. It has been conditionally accepted by NOAO in response to a call for major new instrumentation and a high-impact science program for the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak. The BigBOSS instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking 5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 340 nm to 1060 nm, with a resolution R = 3000-4800. Using data from imaging surveys that are already underway, spectroscopic targets are selected that trace the underlying dark matter distribution. In particular, targets include luminous red galaxies (LRGs) up to z = 1.0, extending the BOSS LRG survey in both redshift and survey area. To probe the universe out to even higher redshift, BigBOSS will target bright [OII] emission line galaxies (ELGs) up to z = 1.7. In total, 20 million galaxy redshifts are obtained to measure the BAO feature, trace the matter power spectrum at smaller scales, and detect redshift space distortions. BigBOSS will provide additional constraints on early dark energy and on the curvature of the universe by measuring the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 600,000 2.2 < z < 3.5 quasars. BigBOSS galaxy BAO measurements combined with an analysis of the broadband power, including the Ly-alpha forest in BigBOSS quasar spectra, achieves a FOM of 395 with Planck plus Stage III priors. This FOM is based on conservative assumptions for the analysis of broad band power (kmax = 0.15), and could grow to over 600 if current work allows us to push the analysis to higher wave numbers (kmax = 0.3). BigBOSS will also place constraints on theories of modified gravity and inflation, and will measure the sum of neutrino masses to 0.024 eV accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Some of the next-generation massive spectroscopic survey projects plan to use thousands of fiber positioner robots packed at a focal plane to quickly move the fiber ends in parallel from the previous to the next target points. The most direct trajectories are prone to collision that could damage the robots and have an impact on the survey operation. We thus present here a motion planning method based on a novel decentralized navigation function for collision-free coordination of fiber positioners. The navigation function takes into account the configuration of positioners as well as the actuator constraints. We provide details of the proof of convergence and collision avoidance. Decentralization results in linear complexity for the motion planning as well as no dependence of motion duration on the number of positioners. Therefore, the coordination method is scalable for large-scale spectrograph robots. The short in-motion duration of positioner robots will thus allow the time dedicated for observation to be maximized.},

@article{Morales:2012aa,
	Abstract = {We present an optimized algorithm for assigning fibres to targets in next-generation fibre-fed multi-object spectrographs. The method, which we have called the draining algorithm, ensures that the maximum number of targets in a given target field is observed in the first few tiles. Using randomly distributed targets and mock galaxy catalogues, we have estimated that the gain provided by the draining algorithm, compared to a random assignment, can be as much as 2 per cent for the first tiles. For a survey such as the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BigBOSS), this would imply saving for observation several hundred thousand objects or, alternatively, reducing the covered area in ˜350 deg2. An important advantage of this method is that the fibre collision problem can be solved easily and in an optimal way. We also discuss the additional optimizations of the fibre-positioning process. In particular, we show that if we allow for the rotation of the focal plane, we can improve the efficiency of the process by ˜3.5-4.5 per cent, even if only small adjustments are permitted (up to 2$\,^{\circ}$). For instruments that allow large rotations of the focal plane, the expected gain increases to ˜5-6 per cent. Therefore, these results strongly support the use of focal plane rotation in future spectrographs, as far as the efficiency of the fibre-positioning process is concerned. Finally, we discuss the implications of our optimizations and provide some basic hints for an optimal survey strategy, based on the number of targets per positioner.},

	Abstract = {We present the first measurements of clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy redshift survey. Our sample consists of 29,300 galaxies with redshifts 5700kms-1<=cz<=39,000kms-1, distributed in several long but narrow (2.5d-5$\,^{\circ}$) segments, covering 690 deg2. For the full, flux-limited sample, the redshift-space correlation length is approximately 8 h-1 Mpc. The two-dimensional correlation function xi(rp,pi) shows clear signatures of both the small-scale, ``fingers-of-God'' distortion caused by velocity dispersions in collapsed objects and the large-scale compression caused by coherent flows, though the latter cannot be measured with high precision in the present sample. The inferred real-space correlation function is well described by a power law, xi(r)=(r/6.1+/-0.2h-1Mpc)-1.75+/-0.03, for 0.1h-1Mpc<=r<=16h-1Mpc. The galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion is sigma12~600+/-100kms-1 for projected separations 0.15h-1Mpc<=rp<=5h-1Mpc. When we divide the sample by color, the red galaxies exhibit a stronger and steeper real-space correlation function and a higher pairwise velocity dispersion than do the blue galaxies. The relative behavior of subsamples defined by high/low profile concentration or high/low surface brightness is qualitatively similar to that of the red/blue subsamples. Our most striking result is a clear measurement of scale-independent luminosity bias at r<~10h-1Mpc: subsamples with absolute magnitude ranges centered on M*-1.5, M*, and M*+1.5 have real-space correlation functions that are parallel power laws of slope ~-1.8 with correlation lengths of approximately 7.4, 6.3, and 4.7 h-1 Mpc, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Recent large-scale galaxy spectroscopic surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enable us to execute a systematic, relatively unbiased search for galaxy clusters. Such surveys make it possible to measure the 3D distribution of galaxies but are hampered by the incompleteness problem due to fiber collisions. In this study we aim to develop a density-measuring technique that alleviates the problem and derives densities more accurately by adding additional cluster member galaxies that follow optical color-magnitude relations for the given redshift. The new density measured with both spectroscopic and photometric data shows a good agreement with apparent information on cluster images and is supported by follow-up observations. By adopting this new method, a total of 924 robust galaxy clusters are found from the SDSS DR5 database in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.1, of which 212 are new. Local maximum-density galaxies successfully represent cluster centers. We provide the cluster catalog including a number of cluster parameters.},

@article{Blanton:2003ab,
	Abstract = {Large surveys using multiobject spectrographs require automated methods for deciding how to efficiently point observations and how to assign targets to each pointing. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 106 spectra from targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 deg2, using a multiobject fiber spectrograph that can simultaneously observe 640 objects in a circular field of view (referred to as a ``tile'') 1.49d in radius. No two fibers can be placed closer than 55" during the same observation; multiple targets closer than this distance are said to ``collide.'' We present here a method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers that includes the effects of collisions and that is nearly optimally efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering of the sky with equally spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally spaced distribution that provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we can attain a sampling rate of greater than 92% for all targets, and greater than 99% for the set of targets that do not collide with each other, with an efficiency greater than 90% (defined as the fraction of available fibers assigned to targets). The methods used here may prove useful to those planning other large surveys.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) sample, which consists of 264 283 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7 spanning 3275 deg2. Both peculiar velocities and errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ('Alcock-Paczynski effect') generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientation with respect to the line of sight. Together with the sharp baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) standard ruler, our measurements of the broad-band shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain the comoving angular diameter distance (2190 $\pm$ 61 Mpc) to z = 0.57, the Hubble expansion rate at z = 0.57 (92.4 $\pm$ 4.5 km s-1 Mpc-1) and the growth rate of structure at that same redshift (dsigma8/d ln a = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.069). Our analysis provides the best current direct determination of both DA and H in galaxy clustering data using this technique. If we further assume a Lambdacold dark matter expansion history, our growth constraint tightens to dsigma8/d ln a = 0.415 $\pm$ 0.034. In combination with the cosmic microwave background, our measurements of DA, H and dsigma8/d ln a all separately require dark energy at z > 0.57, and when combined imply OmegaLambda = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.016, independent of the Universe's evolution at z < 0.57. All of these constraints assume scale-independent linear growth, and assume general relativity to compute both O(10 per cent) non-linear model corrections and our errors. In our companion paper, Samushia et al., we explore further cosmological implications of these observations.},

@article{Tinker:2012aa,
	Abstract = {We place constraints on the average density (Omega m ) and clustering amplitude (sigma8) of matter using a combination of two measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: the galaxy two-point correlation function, wp (rp ), and the mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, M/N, analogous to cluster M/L ratios. Our wp (rp ) measurements are obtained from DR7 while the sample of clusters is the maxBCG sample, with cluster masses derived from weak gravitational lensing. We construct nonlinear galaxy bias models using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) to fit both wp (rp ) and M/N for different cosmological parameters. HOD models that match the same two-point clustering predict different numbers of galaxies in massive halos when Omega m  or sigma8 is varied, thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. We demonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent and competitive with current results from cluster abundance studies, without the use of abundance information. Using wp (rp ) and M/N alone, we find Omega0.5  m sigma8 = 0.465 $\pm$ 0.026, with individual constraints of Omega m  = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.03 and sigma8 = 0.85 $\pm$ 0.06. Combined with current cosmic microwave background data, these constraints are Omega m  = 0.290 $\pm$ 0.016 and sigma8 = 0.826 $\pm$ 0.020. All errors are 1sigma. The systematic uncertainties that the M/N technique are most sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark matter halos and the possibility of redshift evolution between the SDSS Main sample and the maxBCG cluster sample. Our derived constraints are insensitive to the current level of uncertainties in the halo mass function and in the mass-richness relation of clusters and its scatter, making the M/N technique complementary to cluster abundances as a method for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {The results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the anisotropic clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS Data Release 11 sample, which consists of 690827 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43<z<0.70 and has a sky coverage of 8498 deg$^2$ corresponding to an effective volume of $\sim6\,\rm{Gpc}^3$. We fit the Fourier space statistics, the power spectrum and bispectrum monopoles to measure the linear and quadratic bias parameters, $b_1$ and $b_2$, for a non-linear non-local bias model, the growth of structure parameter $f$ and the amplitude of dark matter density fluctuations parametrised by $\sigma_8$. We obtain $b_1(z_{\rm eff})^{1.40}\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=1.672\pm 0.060$ and $b_2^{0.30}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.579\pm0.082$ at the effective redshift of the survey, $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. The main cosmological result is the constraint on the combination $f^{0.43}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.582\pm0.084$, which is complementary to $f\sigma_8$ constraints obtained from 2-point redshift space distortion analyses. A less conservative analysis yields $f^{0.43}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.584\pm0.051$. We ensure that our result is robust by performing detailed systematic tests using a large suite of survey galaxy mock catalogs and N-body simulations. The constraints on $f^{0.43}\sigma_8$ are useful for setting additional constrains on neutrino mass, gravity, curvature as well as the number of neutrino species from galaxy surveys analyses (as presented in a companion paper).},

	Abstract = {We analyse the anisotropic clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, which consists of 690 827 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7 and has a sky coverage of 8498 deg2. We perform our analysis in Fourier space using a power spectrum estimator suggested by Yamamoto et al. We measure the multipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in the sense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and the integral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic power spectrum and without the need to split the survey into subregions. The main cosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acoustic oscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which are distorted by the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Together, these signals allow us to constrain the distance ratio DV(zeff)/rs(zd) = 13.89 $\pm$ 0.18, the Alcock-Paczynski parameter FAP(zeff) = 0.679 $\pm$ 0.031 and the growth rate of structure f (zeff)sigma8(zeff) = 0.419 $\pm$ 0.044 at the effective redshift zeff = 0.57. We emphasize that our constraints are robust against possible systematic uncertainties. In order to ensure this, we perform a detailed systematics study against CMASS mock galaxy catalogues and N-body simulations. We find that such systematics will lead to 3.1 per cent uncertainty for fsigma8 if we limit our fitting range to k = 0.01-0.20 h Mpc-1, where the statistical uncertainty is expected to be three times larger. We did not find significant systematic uncertainties for DV/rs or FAP. Combining our data set with Planck to test General Relativity (GR) through the simple gamma-parametrization, where the growth rate is given by f(z) = Omega ^{gamma }_m(z), reveals a ˜2sigma tension between the data and the prediction by GR. The tension between our result and GR can be traced back to a tension in the clustering amplitude sigma8 between CMASS and Planck.},

@article{Cole:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We present a power-spectrum analysis of the final 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the preferred parameters are Omegamh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a baryon fraction Omegab/Omegam= 0.185 +/- 0.046 (1sigma errors). The value of Omegamh is 1sigma lower than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density significantly below the standard Omegam= 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer Omegam= 0.231 +/- 0.021.},

@article{Percival:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We extend the Fourier transform based method for the analysis of galaxy redshift surveys of Feldman, Kaiser & Peacock (FKP) to model luminosity-dependent clustering. In a magnitude-limited survey, galaxies at high redshift are more luminous on average than galaxies at low redshift. Galaxy clustering is observed to increase with luminosity, so the inferred density field is effectively multiplied by an increasing function of radius. This has the potential to distort the shape of the recovered power spectrum. In this paper, we present an extension of the FKP analysis method to incorporate this effect, and present revised optimal weights to maximize the precision of such an analysis. The method is tested and its accuracy is assessed using mock catalogues of the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). We also show that the systematic effect caused by ignoring luminosity-dependent bias was negligible for the initial analysis of the 2dFGRS of Percival et al. However, future surveys, sensitive to larger scales, or covering a wider range of galaxy luminosities, will benefit from this refined method.},

MPFIT inherits the robustness of the original FORTRAN version of MINPACK-1, but is optimized for performance and convenience in IDL.  In addition to the main fitting engine, MPFIT, several specialized functions are provided to fit 1-D curves and 2-D images, 1-D and 2-D peaks, and interactive fitting from the IDL command line.  Several constraints can be applied to model parameters, including fixed constraints, simple bounding constraints, and ``tying'' the value to another parameter.  Several data-weighting methods are allowed, and the parameter covariance matrix is computed. Extensive diagnostic capabilities are available during the fit, via a call-back subroutine, and after the fit is complete.  Several different forms of documentation are provided, including a tutorial, reference pages, and frequently asked questions.  The package has been translated to C and Python as well.  The full IDL and C packages can be found at http://purl.com/net/mpfit.},

@article{Scoccimarro:2002aa,
	Abstract = {Current models of galaxy formation applied to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe have two parts. The first is an accurate solution of the equations of motion for the dark matter caused by gravitational clustering. The second consists of making physically reasonable approximations to the behaviour of baryons inside dark matter haloes. The first uses large, computationally intensive, N-body simulations. We argue that because the second step is, at least at present, uncertain, it is possible to obtain similar galaxy distributions without solving the first step exactly. We describe an algorithm that is several orders of magnitude faster than N-body simulations, but that is, nevertheless, rather accurate. The algorithm combines perturbation theory with virialized halo models of the non-linear density and velocity fields. For two- and three-point statistics the resulting fields are exact on large scales, and rather accurate well into the non-linear regime, particularly for two-point statistics in real and redshift space. We then show how one can use this algorithm to generate mock galaxy distributions from halo occupation numbers. As a first application, we show that it provides a good description of the clustering of galaxies in the PSCz survey. We also discuss applications to the estimation of non-Gaussian contributions to the error bars and the covariance matrix of the power spectrum, in real and redshift space, for galaxies and dark matter. The results for the latter show good agreement with simulations, supporting the use of our method for constraining cosmological parameters from forthcoming galaxy surveys.},

@article{Soneira:1977aa,
	Abstract = {A sample of 1095 single (S) and associated (A) galaxies with apparent brightness not less than 14.0 magnitudes is analyzed empirically to determine whether the S galaxies have the statistical properties expected of a field population. Two-point functions describing the clustering of the S galaxies and their correlation with the A galaxies are examined, and the frequency distributions of nearest neighbors are considered for both the S and A galaxies. Cross correlations of the S and A components with fainter galaxies listed in the Zwicky catalog are investigated, the number-magnitude relations for S and A galaxies are discussed, and it is found that both components share the same inhomogeneous clustered distribution around the Galaxy. Model catalogs based on hierarchical clustering are constructed which show that the S component can be accounted for without invoking any field population at all. It is concluded that if there is a galaxy population that might usefully be called a uniform field, it amounts to substantially less than 18% in a sample selected by apparent magnitude. In this case, so-called field galaxies might be members of diffuse outer components of groups and clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We develop a general method for power-spectrum analysis of three-dimensional redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical uncertainty in the power, and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that the long-wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian-distributed. We apply the formalism to the updated one-in-six Queen Mary College, Durham, Oxford, and Toronto (QDOT) IRAS redshift survey and compare our results with data from other probes: APM angular correlations and the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from, e.g., counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model with (Omega h) approx. = 0.5. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with (Omega h) as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best-fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long-wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of 10 times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.},

	Abstract = {Sophisticated analysis of modern large-scale structure surveys requires mock catalogues. Mock catalogues are used to optimize survey design, test reduction and analysis pipelines, make theoretical predictions for basic observables and propagate errors through complex analysis chains. We present a new method, which we call `quick particle mesh', for generating many large volume, approximate mock catalogues at low computational cost. The method is based on using rapid, low-resolution particle mesh simulations that accurately reproduce the large-scale dark matter density field. Particles are sampled from the density field based on their local density such that they have N-point statistics nearly equivalent to the haloes resolved in high-resolution simulations, creating a set of mock haloes that can be populated using halo occupation methods to create galaxy mocks for a variety of possible target classes.},

@inproceedings{McBride:2009aa,
	Abstract = {The statistical strength of galaxy redshift surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have ushered us into the era of precision measurements of galaxy clustering. We are now fitting physical models to measured clustering statistics. Galaxy clustering is thus in a position to directly constrain cosmological and galaxy formation theories. This paradigm shift from qualitative to quantitative demands that we understand the statistical and systematic errors in our measurements. Moreover, we must quantify the theoretical uncertainties in our models, which are no longer clearly sub-dominant to observational errors.  We address this emerging need with the LasDamas project (LArge Suite of DArk MAtter Simulations) by producing an unprecedented number of independent and realistic mock galaxy catalogs. To date, we have run over 100 independent N-body realizations using a fixed cosmology and initialized using 2nd order Lagrangian perturbation theory. We populate overdensities of dark matter using the halo occupation distribution framework, designed to match both small and large scale clustering of the observed SDSS data. A series of mock galaxy catalogs matching the geometry of the final SDSS release (DR7) are created over a wide luminosity range to correspond to Main and LRG volume-limited samples. We include important observational effects, such as redshift distortions and fiber collisions. These galaxy mocks are publicly available.},

@article{Guo:2012aa,
	Abstract = {In fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of the fiber plugs prevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting the ability to study galaxy clustering on all scales. We present a new method for correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statistics based on spectroscopic observations. The target galaxy sample is divided into two distinct populations according to the targeting algorithm of fiber placement, one free of fiber collisions and the other consisting of collided galaxies. The clustering statistics are a combination of the contributions from these two populations. Our method makes use of observations in tile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population, and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. The method is rooted in solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the full three-dimensional (3D) redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) on scales both below and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor and angular correction methods. We discuss potential systematic effects in our method. The statistical correction accuracy of our method is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the square root of) the volume probed. For a sample similar to the final SDSS-III BOSS galaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the level of 1% on scales ~0.1-30 h -1 Mpc for the 2PCFs. The systematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by imperfect correction of collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5%. Our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering statistics as well, enables more accurate measurements of full 3D galaxy clustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys.},

@article{Anderson:2012aa,
	Abstract = {We present measurements of galaxy clustering from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264 283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z = 0.57 and redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7. Assuming a concordance LambdaCDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n¯≈3×10-4 h-3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5sigma in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II luminous red galaxy sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7sigma. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV/rs = 13.67 $\pm$ 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV (z = 0.57) = 2094 $\pm$ 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

	Abstract = {We use measurements of the stellar mass function, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-galaxy lensing within the COSMOS survey to constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of star forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range z = [0.2, 1.0]. For massive galaxies, M * >~ 1010.6 M &sun;, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M * ~ 1010 M &sun;, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.},

@article{Tinker:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal <~ 10^10.0 Msol/h^2), there is no correlation between f_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

	Abstract = {We present a study of the clustering and halo occupation distribution of BOSS CMASS galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7 drawn from the Final SDSS-III Data Release. We compare the BOSS results with the predictions of a halo abundance matching (HAM) clustering model that assigns galaxies to dark matter halos selected from the large BigMultiDark N-body simulation of a flat $\Lambda$CDM Planck cosmology. We compare the observational data with the simulated ones on a light-cone constructed from 20 subsequent outputs of the simulation. Observational effects such as incompleteness, geometry, veto masks and fiber collisions are included in the model, which reproduces within 1-$\sigma$ errors the observed monopole of the 2-point correlation function at all relevant scales{: --} from the smallest scales, 0.5 $h^{-1}$Mpc , up to scales beyond the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation feature. This model also agrees remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to $k\sim1$ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and the three-point correlation function. The quadrupole of the correlation function presents some tensions with observations. We discuss possible causes that can explain this disagreement, including target selection effects. Overall, the standard HAM model describes remarkably well the clustering statistics of the CMASS sample. We compare the stellar to halo mass relation for the CMASS sample measured using weak lensing in the CFHT Stripe 82 Survey with the prediction of our clustering model, and find a good agreement within 1-$\sigma$. The BigMD-BOSS light-cone catalogue including properties of BOSS galaxies such as stellar masses, M/L ratios, luminosities, velocity dispersion and halo properties is made publicly available.},

	Abstract = {We describe an efficient and exact method that enables global Bayesian analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The method reveals the joint posterior density (or likelihood for flat priors) of the power spectrum Cl and the CMB signal. Foregrounds and instrumental parameters can be simultaneously inferred from the data. The method allows the specification of a wide range of foreground priors. We explicitly show how to propagate the non-Gaussian dependency structure of the Cl posterior through to the posterior density of the parameters. If desired, the analysis can be coupled to theoretical (cosmological) priors and can yield the posterior density of cosmological parameter estimates directly from the time-ordered data. The method does not hinge on special assumptions about the survey geometry or noise properties, etc., It is based on a Monte Carlo approach and hence parallelizes trivially. No trace or determinant evaluations are necessary. The feasibility of this approach rests on the ability to solve the systems of linear equations which arise. These are of the same size and computational complexity as the map-making equations. We describe a preconditioned conjugate gradient technique that solves this problem and demonstrate in a numerical example that the computational time required for each Monte Carlo sample scales as n3/2p with the number of pixels np. We use our method to analyze the data from the Differential Microwave Radiometer on the Cosmic Background Explorer and explore the non-Gaussian joint posterior density of the Cl from the Differential Microwave Radiometer on the Cosmic Background Explorer in several projections.},

Here we present COSMOABC, a Python ABC sampler featuring a Population Monte Carlo variation of the original ABC algorithm, which uses an adaptive importance sampling scheme. The code is very flexible and can be easily coupled to an external simulator, while allowing to incorporate arbitrary distance and prior functions. As an example of practical application, we coupled COSMOABC with the NUMCOSMO library and demonstrate how it can be used to estimate posterior probability distributions over cosmological parameters based on measurements of galaxy clusters number counts without computing the likelihood function.
